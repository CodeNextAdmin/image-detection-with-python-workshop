# Image Detection with Python and YOLOv8

Instructors, read through the Lesson Plan.
It is recommended that you screenshare model.py and work in that file as a codealong.
Refer to model_answer_key.py for the answers (also represented in the Lesson Plan and Deck)

The three files that the students need (model.py and two jpg's) are already conveniently zipped for you in image_detection.zip
